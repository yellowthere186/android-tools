Explanation:

    APK_PATH: Set this variable to the path of your APK file.
    PACKAGE_NAME: Set this to the package name of your application.
    adb install -r "$APK_PATH": This command installs the APK on the connected device. The -r flag allows reinstallation if the app is already installed.
    adb shell pm grant: These commands grant specific permissions to the app. Replace the permissions with those required by your app.
    adb shell am start -n "$PACKAGE_NAME/.MainActivity": This command starts the main activity of your application.

Running the Script:

    Save the script to a file, for example, install_app.sh.
    Make the script executable:
    bash

chmod +x install_app.sh

Execute the script:
bash

    ./install_app.sh

Make sure you have ADB installed and your Android device connected with USB debugging enabled.
Note:

    This script is intended for development and testing purposes. Installing apps and granting permissions without user interaction should be done responsibly and ethically.
    Ensure you have the necessary permissions and authorization to perform these actions on the device.
