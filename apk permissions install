a script that uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to install an APK and grant permissions without user interaction. This is commonly used for testing and development purposes.

#!/bin/bash

# Path to the APK file
APK_PATH="/path/to/your/app.apk"

# Package name of the app
PACKAGE_NAME="com.example.yourapp"

# Install the APK
adb install -r "$APK_PATH"

# Grant permissions
adb shell pm grant "$PACKAGE_NAME" android.permission.CAMERA
adb shell pm grant "$PACKAGE_NAME" android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
adb shell pm grant "$PACKAGE_NAME" android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
adb shell pm grant "$PACKAGE_NAME" android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

# Start the main activity
adb shell am start -n "$PACKAGE_NAME/.MainActivity"
