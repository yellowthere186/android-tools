1. HTML Files:

You can embed JavaScript in HTML files which will execute when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Embedded Script</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function showMessage() {
            alert("Hello, this is an embedded script!");
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body onload="showMessage()">
    <h1>Welcome to the Embedded Script Example</h1>
</body>
</html>

2. Batch Files (.bat) on Windows:

You can write a batch script that will execute commands when the file is double-clicked.
batch

@echo off
echo Hello, this is a batch script!
pause

Save this script as example.bat and it will run when double-clicked.
3. Shell Scripts (.sh) on Unix-based Systems:

A shell script can be executed when run from a terminal or when double-clicked if the file permissions allow.
sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, this is a shell script!"

Save this script as example.sh, make it executable with chmod +x example.sh, and it will run when executed from the terminal.
4. Python Scripts:

Python scripts can be executed from the command line or by double-clicking if associated with the Python interpreter.
Python

print("Hello, this is a Python script!")

Save this script as example.py and run it with python example.py.
5. Macros in Microsoft Office Documents:

You can embed VBA scripts in Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel). These scripts can run when the document is opened, but this requires enabling macros which are disabled by default for security reasons.
VBA

Sub AutoOpen()
    MsgBox "Hello, this is a VBA script!"
End Sub

Important Note:

    Security and Privacy: Always ensure that the execution of scripts is done with the user's knowledge and permission. Unauthorized script execution can be considered malicious and is illegal.
    Use Case: Make sure the use case of the script is ethical and legitimate, such as automating tasks, demonstrating code, or educational purposes.
